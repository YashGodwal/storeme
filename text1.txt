hey world thanks for coming here now u can do anything u want.

now here are new concepts if git where we know more about branches

1.frst we can check the branches are available:
git brach

2.here we add branch in directory:
git branch <name if branch we can add>

3.then again we have to check the status of directory and if any file is shown modified then it means
git status

4.now we have to add those file which we r modified
git add .

5.now check the status of files again 
git status

6.remember that we are doing work on our other branch right now for some files
